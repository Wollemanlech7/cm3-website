## Introduction to Programming 

### Day 1

Just write to start a para. Use `**word**` to bold **word**. Use `*word*` to italicise. For a new para, you need to hit return at-least twice.

This is another para.

In this one we show some lists. just start the lista on the next line after hitting one return:
- an item
- another item

In this new para we create a numbered list using numbers.
1. first item
2. second item

This shorthand is called Markdown. It is a general text format used almost everywhere on the web. [Google](https://www.google.com) (see how I made this link) about it to learn more. And you can go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).

You can write code by using triple-ticks:

```python
def add_two(x, y):
  return x + y
```

This page illustrates low code principles. In exchange for giving up pixel-level control of the page you can make web pages easily through a simple text file.
